Small TODO:
- decide whether an error should be an exception or a print[Done: exception]

More complex TODO:
- do a check() function in Model that checks if everything is coherent
- get_all_attr function that gives all the attributes of a relation or an object
that extends others.
- check unicity of keys in the json format (redefine the read/parse function)
- flattening with the properties of the parents

[conditionally DONE] flattening and comparison functions
>> need to add number of objects within each model
>> need to add example in tutorial for the three functions (abstraction, flattening, comparison)
