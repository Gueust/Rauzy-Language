Small TODO:
- add  rm_property, set_directional, add_from, add_to, rm_from, rm_to in core.py
- decide whether an error should be an exception or a print

More complex TODO:
- do a check() function in Model that checks if everything is coherent
- get_all_attr function that gives all the attributes of a relation or an object
that extends others.
- check unicity of keys in the json format (redefine the read/parse function)

[conditionally DONE] flattening and comparison functions
>> need to add number of objects within each model
>> need to add example in tutorial for the three functions (abstraction, flattening, comparison)

Discuss:
- if A has properties, and B extends A has other properties, what are the effective
properties of B, and what are the properties really written in B.

- flattening with the properties of the parents
