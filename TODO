Small TODO:
- add  rm_property, set_directional, add_from, add_to, rm_from, rm_to in core.py
- do not print extends, toSet, fromSet, directional properties when they are empty in relations
- do not print extends, objects, relations and properties when they are empty in objects

More complex TODO:
- do a check() function in Model that checks if everything is coherent

Discuss:
- if A has properties, and B extends A has other properties, what are the effective
properties of B, and what are the properties really written in B.
